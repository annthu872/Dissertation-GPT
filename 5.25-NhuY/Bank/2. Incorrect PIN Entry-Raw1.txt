Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Incorrect PIN Entry - Error Message Display
objective: Verify that the ATM displays an error message when an incorrect PIN is entered
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Insert an ATM card into the ATM machine.
  - Step 2: Enter an incorrect PIN when prompted.
expectedResult: The ATM displays an error message indicating that the PIN entered is incorrect.
explanation: This test case is designed to validate the system's response to an incorrect PIN entry, which is a critical part of the 'Withdraw Money' use case. It directly tests the extension 2a, ensuring that the system correctly handles authentication errors.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Incorrect PIN Entry - Retry Limit
objective: Verify that the ATM allows for a limited number of incorrect PIN entries before taking further action
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Insert an ATM card into the ATM machine.
  - Step 2: Enter an incorrect PIN when prompted.
  - Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for the maximum allowed attempts.
expectedResult: After the maximum number of incorrect attempts, the ATM takes a predefined action (e.g., retains the card, alerts the bank, etc.), rather than simply displaying an error message.
explanation: This test case explores the system's handling of multiple incorrect PIN entries, which is an important security feature. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided scenario, it's a common extension of handling incorrect PIN entries in real-world ATM systems.
