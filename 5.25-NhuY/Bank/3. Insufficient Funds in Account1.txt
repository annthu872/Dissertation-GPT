Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Withdraw Money within Allowable Limit but Insufficient Funds
objective: Verify that the ATM displays an error message when a customer attempts to withdraw money within the allowable limit but has insufficient funds in their account.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Insert a valid ATM card into the ATM machine.
  - Step 2: Enter the correct PIN when prompted.
  - Step 3: Select 'Withdraw Cash' from the available actions displayed by the ATM.
  - Step 4: Select an account from which to withdraw the money.
  - Step 5: Enter an amount to withdraw that is within the ATM's allowable limit but exceeds the available balance in the selected account.
expectedResult: The ATM displays an error message indicating insufficient funds.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also accurately reflects the 'Insufficient Funds in Account' scenario. It adds an additional layer of complexity by ensuring the requested withdrawal amount is within the ATM's dispensing limit, yet the transaction cannot proceed due to insufficient funds in the customer's account. It tests the ATM's ability to handle transactions that are technically feasible in terms of withdrawal limits but are constrained by account balances.
