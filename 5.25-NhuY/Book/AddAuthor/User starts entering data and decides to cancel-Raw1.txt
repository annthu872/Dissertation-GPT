  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Start entering data into the form fields for 'Name' and 'Bio'.
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, click the 'Cancel' button.

explanation: This test case ensures that when a user decides to cancel the creation of a new author after starting to enter data but before submission, the data is not saved and the user is redirected back to the list of authors. It directly matches the scenario of cancelling the operation as described.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Navigate Away from New Author Creation Before Submission
objective: Verify that navigating away from the author creation page before submission does not save data
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the form for adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Begin entering 'Name' and 'Bio' data into the form.
  - Step 4: Without pressing the 'Submit' button, select the menu item 'Books'.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered data and should display the 'Books' page with updated data.
explanation: This test case verifies that if a user navigates away from the new author creation form to another section of the application (e.g., 'Books') before submitting the form, the data entered is not saved. It addresses the scenario where the user changes their mind and decides to perform a different action without completing the author creation process.
