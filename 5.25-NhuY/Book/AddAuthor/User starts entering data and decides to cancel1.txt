Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel New Author Creation Before Submission
objective: Verify that the author creation process can be cancelled before submission and no data is saved
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Start entering data into the form fields for 'Name' and 'Bio'.
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, click the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered data and should display the list of authors records.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly reflects the given test scenario where a user starts entering data for a new author but decides to cancel before submission. It checks that the cancellation process works as intended and that no data is saved, which is exactly what the scenario describes.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Navigate Away from New Author Creation Before Submission
objective: Verify that navigating away from the author creation page before submission does not save data
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the form for adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Begin entering 'Name' and 'Bio' data into the form.
  - Step 4: Without pressing the 'Submit' button, select the menu item 'Books'.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered data and should display the 'Books' page with updated data.
reflect: yes
explanation: Although this test case explores a different user action (navigating away instead of explicitly clicking 'Cancel'), it still tests the core aspect of the given scenario: ensuring that partially entered data is not saved when the user decides not to complete the action. It verifies the system's behavior in a situation where the user changes their mind and moves to a different part of the application, which is a valid path within the described scenario.
