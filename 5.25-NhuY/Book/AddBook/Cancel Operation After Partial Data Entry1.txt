Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation After Partial Data Entry by Cancel Button
objective: Verify that the book creation process can be canceled after partially entering data by using the 'Cancel' button, and ensure that no data is saved to the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new book.
  - Step 3: On the book creation form, enter partial data for the new book (e.g., Title and Author).
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered data and should redirect the user to the list of book records, displaying the list without the partially entered book.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario of canceling an operation after partial data entry. It specifically tests the functionality of the 'Cancel' button in the context of partially entered data, ensuring that the operation is canceled and no data is saved, which is the core of the given test scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation After Partial Data Entry by Navigation
objective: Verify that navigating away from the book creation page after partially entering data cancels the creation process without saving data to the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new book.
  - Step 3: On the book creation form, enter partial data for the new book (e.g., Genre and Description).
  - Step 4: Without submitting the form, select a different menu item (e.g., 'Authors').
expectedResult: The application should not save the partially entered data and should display the selected page (e.g., Authors page) without any impact from the canceled book creation process.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also directly reflects the given test scenario by testing a different method of canceling the book creation process (navigation away from the page) after partial data entry. It ensures that the application behaves as expected when the user decides to cancel the operation without using a 'Cancel' button, which is a valid path in the scenario of canceling an operation after partial data entry.
