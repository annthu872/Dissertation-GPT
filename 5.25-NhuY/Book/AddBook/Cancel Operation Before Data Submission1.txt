explanation: This test case directly reflects the given test scenario, which is 'Cancel Operation Before Data Submission.' It specifically tests the functionality of canceling the operation of adding a new book before the data is submitted, ensuring that no data is saved, which is the core objective of the scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation and Navigate to Another Page
objective: Verify that navigating away from the book creation page before submission cancels the operation and no data is saved
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the book creation form.
  - Step 3: Begin entering book details (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date) into the form.
  - Step 4: Without submitting the form, select a different menu item (e.g., 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API').
expectedResult: Navigation away from the book creation page is successful, the book creation process is canceled, no data is saved to the database, and the user is taken to the selected page.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also accurately reflects the given test scenario by testing a different path to cancel the operation before data submission. Instead of explicitly clicking a 'Cancel' button, it verifies that navigating away from the book creation page also cancels the operation and prevents data from being saved. It aligns with the scenario's objective of ensuring no data submission occurs if the operation is canceled by any means.
