  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the book creation form.
  - Step 3: Start entering data into the book form fields (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, click on the 'Authors' menu item to navigate away from the book creation page.
