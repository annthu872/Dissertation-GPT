Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Edit Book with Incorrect Data
objective: Verify that the application displays incorrect data messages when user attempts to update a book with invalid data
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, enter incorrect data for one or more fields (e.g., an invalid publication date format).
  - Step 4: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The application displays messages indicating which fields have been filled incorrectly.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system properly validates user input and provides feedback when data does not meet the expected format or criteria. It directly relates to the scenario where incorrect data is entered during the book update process.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Edit Book and Cancel
objective: Verify that no changes are made to the book record in the database when the user cancels the update operation

  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Enter new data into one or more of the book's fields.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application does not update the book in the database and displays the list of book records, showing the original data for the book that was being edited.
