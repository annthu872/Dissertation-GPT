Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Editing Author by Pressing 'Cancel' Button
objective: Verify that pressing the 'Cancel' button while editing an author's details cancels the operation and does not update the author's information in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, start entering or modifying the author's Name and Bio.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form.
expectedResult: The operation is canceled, no data is updated in the database, and the list of author records is displayed to the user.
explanation: This test case ensures that the 'Cancel' operation works as intended, allowing users to abort the edit operation without making any changes to the author's information in the database. It directly matches the scenario name by testing the cancel operation through the 'Cancel' button.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Navigate Away from Edit Page Without Saving
objective: Verify that navigating away from the edit page by selecting a menu item (e.g., 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API') without saving does not update the author's information in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Begin entering or modifying the author's Name and Bio in the displayed form.
  - Step 4: Without pressing the 'Submit' button, select a menu item such as 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API'.
expectedResult: The user is navigated to the selected page without updating the author's information in the database, ensuring the edit operation is effectively canceled.
explanation: This test case verifies that the system properly handles an implicit cancel operation when the user navigates away from the edit page without saving changes. It is relevant to the scenario as it tests the system's behavior in a situation where the user decides not to complete the edit operation by navigating away.
