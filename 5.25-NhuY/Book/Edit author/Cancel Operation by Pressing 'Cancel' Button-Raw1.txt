Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify Cancel Operation on Edit Book Page
objective: Ensure that pressing the 'Cancel' button while editing a book's information cancels the operation and returns the user to the book list without making changes.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the edit book page, start entering or modifying the book's details such as Title, Author, Genre, Description, and Publication date.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form.
expectedResult: The application should not update the book information in the database and should redirect the user to the list of book records, showing the original data before the attempted edit.
explanation: This test case ensures that the cancel operation works as intended, allowing users to abort the edit operation if they decide not to proceed with changes. It directly tests the cancel operation scenario by simulating a user's action to cancel the edit process.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify Navigation after Cancel Operation on Edit Book Page
objective: To verify that after pressing the 'Cancel' button on the edit book page, the user can successfully navigate to other sections like 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API' without the data being updated.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page and click the 'Update' button next to a book.
  - Step 2: Begin to enter or change the book's information on the edit page.
  - Step 3: Press the 'Cancel' button.
  - Step 4: After being redirected to the list of books, select any menu item such as 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API'.
expectedResult: The application should not save any changes made in the edit form, and the user should be able to navigate to the selected section without issues, displaying the appropriate content without the attempted updates.
explanation: This test case checks the functionality of the cancel operation in conjunction with the application's navigation. It ensures that canceling an edit operation properly resets any temporary data and allows for normal navigation thereafter.
