Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify cancel operation by selecting 'Authors' menu item during book edit
objective: Ensure that selecting 'Authors' menu item while editing a book cancels the operation and navigates to the Authors page without updating the book data in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Begin entering or modifying the book data in the provided form fields (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Instead of clicking the 'Submit' button, select the 'Authors' menu item.
expectedResult: The application should navigate to the Authors page without updating the book data in the database, and the list of books should not reflect any changes made during the edit attempt.
explanation: This test case ensures that the cancel operation works as intended when a user decides to navigate away from the book editing process by selecting a different menu item ('Authors' in this case). It verifies that the application correctly cancels the edit operation, does not save any changes, and properly redirects the user.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify data integrity after canceling book edit by selecting 'Authors'
objective: To confirm that no data is altered in the database for the book being edited when the user cancels the edit operation by selecting 'Authors' from the menu.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Note down or take a screenshot of the current data of a book you are going to edit.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the book list/details page and click the 'Update' button next to the chosen book.
  - Step 3: Make some changes in the book data fields but do not submit these changes.
  - Step 4: Select the 'Authors' menu item to cancel the operation and navigate away from the edit page.
expectedResult: After navigating to the Authors page, if you return to the book details page of the book you attempted to edit, the data should remain unchanged from what was noted in Step 1, confirming that the database was not updated.
explanation: This test case is designed to verify the integrity of the book data after an edit operation is canceled by navigating away from the edit page. It ensures that the application does not inadvertently save any changes when the user cancels the edit operation by selecting a different menu item.
