Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Edit Author Operation by Selecting 'Genres' Menu Item
objective: Verify that the author's data is not updated in the database and the user is navigated to the 'Genres' page when selecting 'Genres' from the menu during an author edit operation.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Begin entering or modifying the data in the author's edit form fields.
  - Step 4: Without pressing the 'Submit' button, select the 'Genres' menu item.
expectedResult: The author's data remains unchanged in the database, and the user is redirected to the 'Genres' page.

It verifies that the operation does not result in unintended data updates and that the application correctly redirects the user.
