Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Edit Operation by Selecting 'Home' Menu Item
objective: Verify that the edit operation is canceled and no data is updated in the database when the 'Home' menu item is selected before submitting the form.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Begin entering or modifying the data in the form fields for the book (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Instead of clicking the 'Submit' button, select the 'Home' menu item.
expectedResult: The application does not update the book data in the database and redirects the user to the Home page. The book list/details page should display without the changes made during the edit attempt.
explanation: This test case ensures that when a user decides to cancel the edit operation by navigating away from the edit page through the 'Home' menu item, the operation is effectively canceled without making any changes to the book data in the database. It directly matches the scenario name by testing the specific action of canceling the edit operation through navigation.
