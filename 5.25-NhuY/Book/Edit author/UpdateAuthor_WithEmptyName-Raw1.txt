Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Update Author with Empty Name Field
objective: Verify that the application prevents updating an author with an empty name field and displays an appropriate error message.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Clear the 'Name' field to make it empty.
  - Step 4: Enter or modify data in the 'Bio' field.
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The application should display an error message indicating that the name field cannot be empty and the author record should not be updated in the database.
explanation: This test case ensures that the application enforces the requirement for the author's name to be present when updating an author record. It directly relates to the scenario of updating an author with empty name field by testing the validation mechanism for the name input.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Cancel Update Operation for Author
objective: Verify that the update operation can be canceled after making changes and that no data is updated in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Enter or modify data in the 'Name' and 'Bio' fields.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application should not update the author record in the database and should display the list of authors, showing that no changes have been made.
explanation: This test case checks the functionality of the 'Cancel' button in the update author form, ensuring that it negates any changes made by the user before submission, thus maintaining data integrity.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Navigate Away During Author Update
objective: Verify that navigating away from the update author form without submitting does not update the author in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Enter or modify data in the 'Name' and 'Bio' fields.
  - Step 4: Without pressing 'Submit', select the menu item 'Books'.
expectedResult: The application should not update the author record in the database and should display the 'Books' page, indicating that the update operation was not completed.
explanation: This test case ensures that if a user navigates away from the update author form without submitting it, the changes are not saved, thus preventing unintended updates.
