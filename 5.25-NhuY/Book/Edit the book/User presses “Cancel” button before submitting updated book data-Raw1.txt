Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify cancel operation during book data update
objective: Ensure that pressing the 'Cancel' button before submitting updated book data does not update the book in the database and redirects the user to the book list.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, start entering new data for the book (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, click the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The book data is not updated in the database, and the user is redirected to the list of book records.
explanation: This test case verifies that the cancel operation works as intended by ensuring that no data is updated in the database when the 'Cancel' button is pressed before submitting the form. It directly matches the scenario name by testing the functionality of the 'Cancel' button in the book data update process.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify navigation after cancel operation during book update
objective: To confirm that after pressing the 'Cancel' button during book update, the user is redirected to the book list and can navigate to other sections without updating the book.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Go to the book list/details page and click the 'Update' button for a book.
  - Step 2: Begin to enter or modify the book's details in the form.
  - Step 3: Press the 'Cancel' button before submitting the updated data.
  - Step 4: After being redirected to the book list, select another menu item such as 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API'.
expectedResult: User is redirected to the book list after pressing 'Cancel', and can navigate to other sections without the book data being updated in the database.
explanation: This test case ensures that the cancel operation not only prevents data from being updated but also allows the user to navigate to other sections of the application without unintended data submission. It complements the scenario by testing the post-cancel navigation behavior.
