objective: Verify that the system prevents the creation of a new lesson without a lesson name
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Press the tab 'Lesson Management' on the navbar.
  - Step 3: Select 'Add new Lesson' from the dropdown menu.
  - Step 4: Leave the name field empty.

  - Step 6: Select 'Save' to attempt creating a new lesson.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating that the lesson name is required and prevent the lesson from being created.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the system enforces the requirement for a lesson name during the lesson creation process. It directly addresses the scenario of attempting to create a lesson without providing a name, which is not covered explicitly in the use case but is a critical validation to ensure data integrity and usability.
