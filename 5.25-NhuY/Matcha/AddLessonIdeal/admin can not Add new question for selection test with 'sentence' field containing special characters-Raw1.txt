  - Step 7: Choose the option to add 'Create questions for the selection test'.
  - Step 8: Fill the 'sentence' field with a sentence that includes special characters (e.g., '@#$%^&*').
  - Step 9: Fill the 'correct answer' field with a valid word.
  - Step 10: Fill the 'other option 1', 'other option 2', 'other option 3' fields with three different wrong answer words.
  - Step 11: Press the 'Save' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that 'Sentence is invalid', preventing the admin from saving the question.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system enforces the rule that sentences in the 'sentence' field must not contain any special characters, as per the use case specification. It directly tests the scenario where an admin attempts to add a new question with a 'sentence' containing special characters, which should not be allowed.
