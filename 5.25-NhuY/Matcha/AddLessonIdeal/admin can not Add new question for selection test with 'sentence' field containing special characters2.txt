reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by verifying that the system prevents the admin from adding a new question with special characters in the 'sentence' field. It follows the exact steps an admin would take to add a new question and checks for the specific condition (presence of special characters) that should trigger the system's validation rule. The expected result aligns with the scenario's requirement, making it a valid and reflective test case.
