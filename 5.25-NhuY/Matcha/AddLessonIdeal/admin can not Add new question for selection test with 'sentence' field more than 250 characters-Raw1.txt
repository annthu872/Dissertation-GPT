testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system as an Admin.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the 'Lesson Management' tab on the navbar.

  - Step 7: Choose the option 'Create questions for the selection test'.
  - Step 8: In the 'sentence' field, input a sentence that is more than 250 characters long, including a symbol '...'.
  - Step 9: Fill in the 'correct answer' field with a valid word, and fill in 'other option 1', 'other option 2', 'other option 3' fields with different wrong answer words.
  - Step 10: Press the 'Save' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification or error message indicating that the 'sentence' field cannot exceed 250 characters and prevent the question from being saved.

It directly tests the system's validation mechanism for the 'sentence' field length during the question creation process.
