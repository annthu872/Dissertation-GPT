reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by verifying that the system enforces a limit on the 'sentence' field length during the question creation process for a selection test. It includes steps to attempt adding a question with a sentence exceeding the specified character limit and checks for the appropriate system response, which is to prevent the question from being saved and to display an error message. Therefore, it accurately reflects the given test scenario.
