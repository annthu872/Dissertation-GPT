  - Step 11: Press the button 'Save'.
expectedResult: System shows notification that 'Sentence is invalid', prompting Admin to re-enter the 'sentence' field with '...'.

It directly addresses the scenario where an admin attempts to add a new question without the required '...' in the 'sentence' field.
