  - Step 10: Fill in the 'other option 1', 'other option 2', and 'other option 3' fields with different wrong answers.
  - Step 11: Press the 'Save' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that 'Admin did not fill all the fields', prompting the Admin to fill the missing 'correct answer' field.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system enforces the requirement for all compulsory fields, including the 'correct answer' field, to be filled before a new question for the selection test can be added. It directly tests the system's handling of the scenario where the 'correct answer' field is left empty, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the selection test questions.
