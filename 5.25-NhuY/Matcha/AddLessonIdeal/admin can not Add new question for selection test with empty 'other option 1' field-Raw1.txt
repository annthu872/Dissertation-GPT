Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify admin cannot add new question for selection test with empty 'other option 1' field
objective: Ensure the system prevents adding a new question for the selection test if the 'other option 1' field is left empty by the admin
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system as an Admin.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the 'Lesson Management' tab on the navbar.
  - Step 3: Select a Lesson from the Lesson list.
  - Step 4: Select a Topic from the Topic list of the selected Lesson.
  - Step 5: Select a word from the vocabulary word list.
  - Step 6: Press the 'Add new question' button.
  - Step 7: Choose the option 'Create questions for the selection test'.
  - Step 8: Fill in the 'sentence' field with a valid sentence that includes the symbol '...'.
  - Step 9: Fill in the 'correct answer' field with the correct word form of the blank in the sentence.
  - Step 10: Leave the 'other option 1' field empty.
  - Step 11: Fill in the 'other option 2' and 'other option 3' fields with different wrong answer words.
  - Step 12: Press the 'Save' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that 'Admin did not fill all the fields', prompting the Admin to fill the missing 'other option 1' field.
explanation: This test case is designed to verify that the system enforces the requirement for all compulsory fields, including 'other option 1', to be filled before a new question for the selection test can be added. It directly addresses the scenario where an admin attempts to add a new question without completing all required fields.
