reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by attempting to add a new question with a specific field ('other option 2') left empty. It follows the exact steps an admin would take to add a question for a selection test, including the step where the error is expected to occur (leaving 'other option 2' empty). The expected result is aligned with the scenario's requirement that the system should prevent the question from being added without all compulsory fields filled, thereby accurately reflecting the given test scenario.
