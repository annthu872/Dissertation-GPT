  - Step 7: Choose the option 'Create questions for the selection test' when prompted.
  - Step 8: On the 'Add new question for selection test' page, fill in the 'sentence' field with a valid sentence, 'correct answer' field with the correct word, and 'other option 1', 'other option 2', 'other option 3' fields with different wrong answers.
  - Step 9: Instead of saving, press the browser back button.
expectedResult: The system should redirect the Admin to the 'Word Information' page of the selected word, and the question should not be saved.

This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing the creation of incomplete or unintended entries.
