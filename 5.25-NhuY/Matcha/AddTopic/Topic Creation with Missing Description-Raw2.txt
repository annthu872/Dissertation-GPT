objective: Verify that the system prevents the creation of a new topic without a description
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a unique name for the topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Leave the description field empty.
  - Step 5: Click on 'Save' to attempt creating a new topic.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating that the description field cannot be empty and the topic should not be created.
explanation: This test case is designed to ensure that the system enforces the requirement for a description when creating a new topic, which is a deviation from the basic flow where both name and description are provided.

  - Step 3: Enter a unique name for the topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Enter a description for the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Click on 'Save' to create the new topic.
expectedResult: The system should successfully create the new topic and redirect the administrator to the adding vocabulary to new topic section. The new topic should appear in the topic list.

objective: Verify that the system prevents the creation of a new topic with a name that is already used
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a name that is already used for an existing topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Enter a description for the topic in the description field.

expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the name is already used, prompting the administrator to add another name in the name field. The topic should not be created with the duplicate name.
explanation: This test case checks the system's ability to enforce unique names for topics, preventing duplication as outlined in the alternative flow of the use case.
