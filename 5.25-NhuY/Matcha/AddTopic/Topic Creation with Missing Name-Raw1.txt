Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Topic Creation with Missing Name
objective: Verify that the system prevents the creation of a new topic without a name and prompts for a name input
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Select the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Leave the name field empty.
  - Step 4: Fill in the description of the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Select 'Save' to attempt creating a new topic.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message or notification indicating that the name field is required and prevent the creation of the topic until a name is provided.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system enforces the requirement for a topic name during the creation process, preventing the addition of unnamed topics.

  - Step 2: Select the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a name that is already used by an existing topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Fill in the description of the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Select 'Save' to attempt creating a new topic.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the name is already used and prompt the Administrator to add another name in the name field, preventing the creation of the topic with a duplicate name.
explanation: This test case checks the system's ability to enforce unique names for topics, ensuring that each topic can be distinctly identified.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Cancel Topic Creation
