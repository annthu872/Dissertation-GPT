testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the registration page.

reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario 'Password Above Maximum Length' by verifying the system's response to a password input that exceeds the predefined maximum length. The steps are designed to simulate a user's attempt to register with an overly long password, and the expected result is aligned with the scenario's focus on handling invalid password lengths.
