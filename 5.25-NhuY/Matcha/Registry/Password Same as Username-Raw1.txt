Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify password cannot be the same as username during registration
objective: Ensure that the system prevents the user from setting a password identical to their username during the registration process.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the registration page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid username in the username field (ensure the username is over 8 characters and below 30 characters).
  - Step 3: Enter the same value as the username in the password field, ensuring it meets the basic password criteria (over 8 characters and below 30 characters, contains at least one normal character, one capitalized character, one number, and one special character).
  - Step 4: Click on the 'Register' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the password cannot be the same as the username and prevent the user from proceeding to the Home page.
explanation: This test case directly addresses the scenario of preventing a password from being the same as the username, which is a critical security measure in the registration process. It ensures that users cannot use easily guessable passwords, thereby enhancing the security of user accounts.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify successful registration with distinct username and password
objective: Confirm that the system allows the registration process to complete successfully when the username and password are distinct and meet all validity criteria.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the registration page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid username in the username field (ensure the username is over 8 characters and below 30 characters).
  - Step 3: Enter a valid password in the password field that is not the same as the username (ensure the password is over 8 characters and below 30 characters, contains at least one normal character, one capitalized character, one number, and one special character).
  - Step 4: Click on the 'Register' button.
expectedResult: The system should successfully register the user and redirect them to the Home page.
explanation: This test case ensures that the registration process functions correctly when all criteria for username and password are met, including the requirement for the password to be different from the username. It verifies the system's ability to handle valid registration data.
