Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify password cannot be the same as username during registration
objective: Ensure that the system prevents the user from setting a password identical to their username during the registration process.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the registration page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid username in the username field (ensure the username is over 8 characters and below 30 characters).
  - Step 3: Enter the same value as the username in the password field, ensuring it meets the basic password criteria (over 8 characters and below 30 characters, contains at least one normal character, one capitalized character, one number, and one special character).
  - Step 4: Click on the 'Register' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the password cannot be the same as the username and prevent the user from proceeding to the Home page.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the scenario of preventing a password from being the same as the username, which is a critical security measure in the registration process. It ensures that users cannot use easily guessable passwords, thereby enhancing the security of user accounts.
