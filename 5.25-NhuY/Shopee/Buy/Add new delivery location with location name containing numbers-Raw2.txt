  - Step 6: Click Add new location button.
  - Step 7: Fill in the location name with a name that contains numbers (e.g., 'Home123').
  - Step 8: Fill in the rest of the required fields with valid information (phone number, city, district, ward, exact location's address).
  - Step 9: Choose an option for the location type (own house or working place).
  - Step 10: Click on Finish button to save the location.
expectedResult: A notification appears under the location name field indicating that the name format is incorrect because it contains numbers.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the system enforces the rule that location names can only contain letters and must be at least 2 letters long, as specified in the use case for adding a new delivery location. It directly tests the system's validation mechanism for the input format of the location name.
