  - Step 5: On the payment page, click the Change title in the delivery location section.
  - Step 6: Click the Add new location button.
  - Step 7: Fill in the location name with a name that contains numbers (e.g., 'Home123').
  - Step 8: Fill in the rest of the required fields with valid information (e.g., phone number in the correct format, select city, district, ward, and provide a valid address).
  - Step 9: Choose an option for the location type (own house or working place).
  - Step 10: Click on the Finish button to save the location.
expectedResult: A notification appears under the location name field indicating the name format is incorrect, and the system does not allow adding the location.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the system enforces the rule that location names must only contain letters and be at least 2 letters long, as specified in the use case for adding a new delivery location. It directly tests the scenario of attempting to add a new delivery location with a name that does not comply with these rules.
