reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario of adding a new delivery location with a location name containing numbers. It follows the steps that a user would take to add a new delivery location, including the critical step of entering a name with numbers. The expected result clearly states that the system should prevent the addition of the location due to the presence of numbers in the name, which is the exact functionality the test scenario aims to verify. Therefore, this test case accurately reflects the given test scenario by testing the system's ability to enforce naming rules for delivery locations.
