Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Search for an order using order's ID
objective: Verify that the user can search for an order using the order's ID and view the correct order details.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the platform with valid user credentials.
  - Step 2: Click on the personal name and avatar section at the top right of the platform's page to navigate to the personal bought order page.
  - Step 3: Locate the search bar below the status bar on the personal bought order page.
  - Step 4: Enter a valid order's ID into the search bar.
  - Step 5: Press enter.
expectedResult: The system displays the order that matches the entered order's ID, showing correct details and status.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the scenario by outlining steps to search for an order using its ID and expecting the system to display the correct order details. It perfectly matches the scenario's requirement.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Search for an order using order's ID with no matching results
objective: Verify that the system handles searches with an order's ID that does not match any existing orders appropriately.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the platform with valid user credentials.
  - Step 2: Click on the personal name and avatar section at the top right of the platform's page to navigate to the personal bought order page.
  - Step 3: Locate the search bar below the status bar on the personal bought order page.
  - Step 4: Enter an order's ID that does not exist in the system into the search bar.
  - Step 5: Press enter.
expectedResult: The system displays a message indicating that no orders match the entered order's ID.
reflect: yes
explanation: Although this test case explores a negative path (searching for a non-existent order ID), it still directly tests the scenario's functionality by verifying the system's response to an invalid search query. It ensures the search feature is robust and provides user feedback when no results are found, which is a critical aspect of searching for an order by its ID.
