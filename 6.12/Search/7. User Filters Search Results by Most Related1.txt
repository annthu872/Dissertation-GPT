expectedResult: The search results are refreshed to display products, prioritizing those with partial name matches to the keyword first, followed by those with matches in the description, ensuring no exact name matches are available.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also directly reflects the given test scenario by focusing on a specific condition where no exact name matches are present. It tests the system's ability to adapt its prioritization of search results based on partial name matches and description matches, which is a critical aspect of the 'most related' filtering functionality.
