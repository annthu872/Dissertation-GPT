reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by attempting to add a new shipping address with an invalid full name that includes numbers. It follows the exact steps that would trigger the validation rule for full names, making it a perfect reflection of the given test scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Add a new shipping address with an invalid full name with less than 2 letters
objective: Verify that the system prevents adding a new shipping address with a full name that is less than 2 letters long
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log into the Shopee account.
  - Step 2: Perform the 'Purchase' feature to initiate the checkout process.
  - Step 3: Click on the button to change the shipping address.
  - Step 4: Click on the option to add a new address.
  - Step 5: Fill in the full name field with a single letter (e.g., 'J').
  - Step 6: Fill in the rest of the form with valid information.
  - Step 7: Click the 'Finish' button to attempt adding the new shipping address.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification indicating that the full name is invalid because it does not meet the minimum length requirement of 2 letters and prevent the user from adding the new shipping address.
reflect: yes
explanation: Although this test case explores a different validation rule (minimum length of the full name), it still falls under the umbrella of the test scenario, which is to add a new shipping address with an invalid full name. It tests another aspect of what constitutes an 'invalid full name,' thereby reflecting the given test scenario.
