Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify cancellation of author deletion via Cancel button
objective: Ensure that when a user initiates the deletion of an author but decides to cancel, the author's record remains unchanged in the database and the user is redirected back to the list of authors.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the author you wish to delete.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The author's record should not be deleted from the database, and the application should redirect the user to the list of authors, showing the author's record still present.
explanation: This test case ensures that the cancel operation works as intended, preventing unintended deletion of author records and verifying the application's ability to revert the deletion process at the user's request.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify navigation after cancelling author deletion
objective: To confirm that after cancelling the deletion of an author, navigating to other sections like 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API' displays updated data without deleting the author.

  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the author you wish to delete.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
  - Step 4: Select the menu item 'Books'.
  - Step 5: Repeat steps 4 for 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', and 'API' respectively.
expectedResult: After cancelling the deletion, navigating to 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API' should display updated data with the author still present in the database.
explanation: This test case verifies that the application correctly handles navigation after a cancellation of deletion, ensuring data integrity and correct display of information across different sections.
