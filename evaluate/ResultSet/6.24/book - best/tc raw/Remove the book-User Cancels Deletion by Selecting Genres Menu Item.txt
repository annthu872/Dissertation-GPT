Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Deletion and Select 'Genres' Menu Item
objective: Verify that selecting 'Genres' from the menu after initiating a book deletion cancels the deletion and navigates to the 'Genres' page without deleting the book.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the book intended for deletion.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
  - Step 4: After cancellation, select the 'Genres' menu item.
expectedResult: The book is not deleted from the database, and the user is navigated to the 'Genres' page with the data updated to reflect no change in the book records.
explanation: This test case ensures that the cancel operation works as intended when a user decides not to delete a book and instead navigates to another page ('Genres') using the menu. It tests the functionality of cancellation followed by navigation to ensure the book's data remains unchanged.
