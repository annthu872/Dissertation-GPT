Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Cancel Deletion of an Author
objective: Verify that when a user cancels the deletion of an author, the record is not removed from the database and the user is shown the unchanged list of authors.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the author you wish to delete.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The deletion is canceled, the author's record remains in the database, and the user is redirected to the unchanged list of authors.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly reflects the 'Deletion Cancellation Scenario' by testing the functionality where a user cancels the deletion process, ensuring the author's record remains unchanged.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Navigate Away During Deletion Cancellation
objective: Verify that navigating away from the deletion confirmation dialog by selecting any menu item ('Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API') cancels the deletion and retains the author's record.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the author you wish to delete.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, instead of clicking 'Confirm' or 'Cancel', select a menu item such as 'Books'.
expectedResult: The deletion process is aborted, the author's record remains in the database, and the user is redirected to the selected page with updated data.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case aligns with the 'Deletion Cancellation Scenario' by exploring an alternative way to cancel the deletion process, which is by navigating away from the confirmation dialog, thus ensuring the author's record is preserved.
