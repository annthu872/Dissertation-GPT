testCaseName: Successful Booking ID Submission for Checkout
objective: Verify that a guest can successfully submit a valid booking ID and complete the checkout process.

  - Step 1: Navigate to the checkout page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid booking ID that has a valid room ID linked to it.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
  - Step 4: Observe the system's response.
expectedResult: The system should validate the booking ID, remove the linked room ID from the booking ID, update the booking status as complete, and redirect the user to the main page with a 'check out successful' message.

  - Step 1: Navigate to the checkout page.
  - Step 2: Enter an incorrect booking ID.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
  - Step 4: Observe the system's response.
expectedResult: The system should not validate the incorrect booking ID and should redirect the user to the main page with an error message indicating the booking ID is incorrect.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Unsuccessful Booking ID Submission with No Linked Room
objective: Verify that the system correctly handles the scenario where a booking ID without a linked room ID is submitted for checkout.
