Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Generate Report With Invalid Date Range
objective: Verify that the system prevents the generation of a report when the hotel owner inputs an invalid date range and displays an appropriate error message.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system as a Hotel Owner.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Reports Page.
  - Step 3: Click on the Reports Button to generate a new report.
  - Step 4: Enter an invalid date range in the parameters section. (For example, the end date is before the start date.)
  - Step 5: Submit the request to generate the report.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating that the date range is invalid and prevent the report from being generated.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the system correctly handles invalid input in the form of an incorrect date range by the hotel owner when attempting to generate a report. It directly relates to the test scenario of attempting to generate a report with an invalid date range by validating the input parameters before proceeding with report generation.
