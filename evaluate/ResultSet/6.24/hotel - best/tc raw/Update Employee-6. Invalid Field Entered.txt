Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Update Employee with Invalid Field Entry
objective: Verify that the system shows an 'invalid field entered' message when an invalid value is entered in any field during employee update
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system with a manager account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Employee menu by clicking on the Employee option.
  - Step 3: Search for an existing employee using their ID or from the table.
  - Step 4: Once the employee is found, the system will auto-fill all fields with the employee's current information.
  - Step 5: Change one of the fields to an invalid value (e.g., enter alphabets in a numeric field).
  - Step 6: Press the update button to attempt to update the employee information.
expectedResult: The system should display a message indicating that an invalid field has been entered and prevent the update from being processed.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system correctly validates input fields during the employee update process and provides appropriate feedback to the user when invalid data is entered, as per the alternative path in the use case.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Update Employee with Non-Existent ID
objective: Verify that the system shows an 'incorrect value for id' message when a non-existent employee ID is searched
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system with a manager account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Employee menu by clicking on the Employee option.
  - Step 3: Attempt to search for an employee using a non-existent ID.
  - Step 4: Observe the system's response to the search action.
expectedResult: The system should display a message indicating 'incorrect value for id' when a non-existent employee ID is entered in the search field.
explanation: This test case checks the system's ability to handle searches for non-existent employee IDs, ensuring that users are informed when the ID entered does not match any records in the database, as described in the alternative path of the use case.
