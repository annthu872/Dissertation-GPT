Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Login with empty password field
objective: Verify that the system prevents login with an empty password field and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid username in the username field.
  - Step 3: Leave the password field empty.
  - Step 4: Click the submit button.
expectedResult: The system should not allow the login to proceed and should display an error message indicating that the password field cannot be empty.
explanation: This test case is designed to validate the system's behavior when attempting to log in without providing a password. It directly addresses the 'LoginWithEmptyPassword' scenario by testing the system's response to incomplete login credentials, ensuring that users are prompted to fill in all required fields.
