Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Account Lock After Three Failed Login Attempts
objective: Verify that the user account gets locked after three consecutive failed login attempts
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter incorrect credentials (username and password) and press the submit button.
  - Step 3: After the error message is displayed, repeat Step 2 for the second time.
  - Step 4: After the error message is displayed again, repeat Step 2 for the third time.
expectedResult: After the third failed login attempt, the user should see a message indicating that their account has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
