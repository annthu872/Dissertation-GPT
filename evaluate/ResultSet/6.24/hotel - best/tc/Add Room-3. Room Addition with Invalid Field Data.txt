Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Add Room with Invalid Room Name
objective: Verify that the system shows an error when adding a room with an invalid room name
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system with a manager account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Add Room page.
  - Step 3: Fill in all the fields, entering an invalid format for the room name.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Add Room' button.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating the room name is invalid.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario of adding a room with invalid field data, specifically targeting an invalid room name. It follows the scenario's requirement to validate field data during room addition.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Add Room with Empty Required Field
objective: Verify that the system shows an error when attempting to add a room with a required field left empty
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system with a manager account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Add Room page.
  - Step 3: Fill in all the fields except for one required field, leave it empty.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Add Room' button.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating that a required field has been left empty and the room cannot be added.
