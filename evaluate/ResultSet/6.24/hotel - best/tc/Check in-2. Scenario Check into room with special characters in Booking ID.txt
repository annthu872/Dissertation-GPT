testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the check-in page.
  - Step 2: Enter an invalid Booking ID that contains special characters into the Booking ID field.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
expectedResult: The system should recognize the Booking ID as invalid, not update the booking details, and redirect the user to the main page with an error message.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case is relevant to the test scenario as it tests the system's response to an invalid Booking ID with special characters. It ensures that the system can distinguish between valid and invalid IDs, even when they contain special characters, and provides appropriate feedback, which is a critical part of the check-in process.
