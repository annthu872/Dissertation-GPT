explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by focusing on the action of attempting to generate a report with an invalid date range. It includes steps that mimic the user's actions leading up to the error condition and checks for the appropriate system response, which is to display an error message and prevent report generation. Therefore, it accurately reflects the given test scenario.
