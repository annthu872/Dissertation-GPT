Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Report Generation with Valid Parameters but No Data Available
objective: Verify that the system correctly handles the scenario where a report is generated with valid parameters but no data is available for those parameters.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system as a Hotel Owner.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Reports Page.
  - Step 3: Click on the Reports Button to generate a new report.
  - Step 4: Enter valid parameters for report generation that are known to have no data (e.g., a future date range where no bookings or activities have occurred).
  - Step 5: Submit the parameters to generate the report.
expectedResult: The system should display a message or page indicating that no data is available for the selected report parameters, rather than showing an empty report or an error.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly reflects the given test scenario 'Report Generation with No Data Available for Selected Parameters' by specifically testing the system's behavior when a report is generated with valid parameters that yield no data. It verifies the system's ability to communicate effectively with the user under these circumstances, which is the core objective of the test scenario.
