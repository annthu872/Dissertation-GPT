Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: No Services Selected by User
objective: Verify that the system handles the scenario where no services are selected by the user after entering a valid room ID
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the room service request page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid room ID.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button to validate the room ID.
  - Step 4: From the list of room services displayed, do not select any service.
  - Step 5: Attempt to proceed to the next step or submit the request without selecting any services.
expectedResult: The system should either prevent the user from proceeding without selecting a service, displaying a message to select at least one service, or handle the scenario gracefully by informing the user that no services were selected and no charges will be applied.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario 'No Services Selected by User' by outlining steps to replicate the scenario where a user does not select any services after entering a valid room ID. It checks if the system has a mechanism to handle such cases, either by preventing the user from proceeding or by providing appropriate feedback, which is exactly what the scenario aims to test.
