testCaseName: Request Unavailable Room Service
objective: Verify that the system handles requests for unavailable services appropriately by not allowing the request to proceed and providing relevant feedback to the user.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the room service request page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid room ID in the provided input field.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button to validate the room ID.
  - Step 4: From the list of room services displayed, attempt to select a service that is known to be unavailable or not listed.
  - Step 5: Attempt to submit the request for the unavailable service.

reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by simulating a user's attempt to request a service that is unavailable. The steps guide the tester through the process of selecting an unavailable service and the expected result clearly states that the system should prevent the request from proceeding while providing appropriate feedback. This ensures that the system's handling of unavailable service requests is tested, which is the core objective of the given test scenario.
