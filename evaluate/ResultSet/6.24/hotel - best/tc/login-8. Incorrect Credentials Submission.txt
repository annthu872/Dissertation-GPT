Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Incorrect Credentials Submission for Hotel Owner
objective: Verify that the system shows an error message and remains on the login page when a Hotel Owner submits incorrect credentials
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter incorrect username and password for a Hotel Owner account.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating the credentials are incorrect and remain on the login page.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by verifying the system's behavior when incorrect credentials are submitted by a Hotel Owner. It checks for the error message and that the user remains on the login page, which is the core of the test scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Incorrect Credentials Submission for Manager
objective: Verify that the system shows an error message and remains on the login page when a Manager submits incorrect credentials
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter incorrect username and password for a Manager account.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating the credentials are incorrect and remain on the login page.
reflect: yes
explanation: Although this test case focuses on a Manager instead of a Hotel Owner, it still reflects the given test scenario's objective by testing the system's response to incorrect credentials submission. It verifies the same behavior (error message and staying on the login page) for a different user role, which is relevant for comprehensive testing of the system's security measures.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Incorrect Credentials Submission for Employee
objective: Verify that the system shows an error message and remains on the login page when an Employee submits incorrect credentials
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the login page.
  - Step 2: Enter incorrect username and password for an Employee account.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
expectedResult: The system should display an error message indicating the credentials are incorrect and remain on the login page.
reflect: yes
explanation: Similar to Test Case 2, this test case also aligns with the test scenario's objective by examining the system's reaction to incorrect credential submissions, this time for an Employee. It ensures that the system's security measures and user feedback mechanisms are consistently applied across different user roles, which is within the scope of the test scenario.
