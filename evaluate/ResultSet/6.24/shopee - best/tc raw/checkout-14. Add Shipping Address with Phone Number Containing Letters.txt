  - Step 6: Complete the rest of the form with valid information.
  - Step 7: Click the 'Finish' button to attempt adding the new shipping address.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification preventing the user from adding the new shipping address due to the invalid phone number format.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system enforces the input validation rule for the phone number field in the shipping address form, specifically that it cannot contain letters and must follow the format (+84) xxx xxx xxx where all x's are numbers. It directly matches the scenario name by testing the addition of a shipping address with a phone number containing letters.
