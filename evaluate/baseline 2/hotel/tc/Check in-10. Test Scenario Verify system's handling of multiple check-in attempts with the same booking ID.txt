Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify successful check-in with valid booking ID
objective: To ensure that the system allows check-in with a valid booking ID and directs the user to the main page with a success message
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the check-in page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid booking ID.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
  - Step 4: Observe the system's response.
expectedResult: The system validates the booking ID, updates the booking details with the room ID, shows a 'check in successful' message, and redirects the user to the main page.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify system behavior with invalid booking ID
objective: To ensure that the system correctly handles attempts to check in with an invalid booking ID by displaying an error message and redirecting to the main page

  - Step 1: Navigate to the check-in page.
  - Step 2: Enter an invalid booking ID.
  - Step 3: Press the submit button.
  - Step 4: Observe the system's response.
expectedResult: The system fails to validate the booking ID, redirects the user to the main page, and displays an error message.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Verify system's handling of multiple check-in attempts with the same booking ID
objective: To verify that the system prevents multiple check-ins using the same booking ID after a successful check-in
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Successfully check in with a valid booking ID following the steps in Test Case 1.
  - Step 2: Navigate back to the check-in page.
  - Step 3: Re-enter the same booking ID used in Step 1.
  - Step 4: Press the submit button.
