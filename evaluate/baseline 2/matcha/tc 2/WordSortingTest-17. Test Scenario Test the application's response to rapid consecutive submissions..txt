Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify rapid consecutive submissions with correct answers
objective: Verify that the application correctly handles rapid consecutive submissions of correct answers by the learner and displays the appropriate response for each.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log into the application as a learner.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the word sorting test.
  - Step 3: Answer the first question correctly and rapidly press enter multiple times.
  - Step 4: Observe the response of the application.
  - Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for at least 3 different questions.
expectedResult: The application should handle each submission individually, displaying a green pop-up screen for each correct answer, without crashing or showing incorrect behavior.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify rapid consecutive submissions with incorrect answers
objective: Ensure the application can handle rapid consecutive submissions of incorrect answers by the learner and shows the correct response.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log into the application as a learner.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the word sorting test.
  - Step 3: Deliberately arrange the letters in the wrong order and rapidly press enter multiple times.
  - Step 4: Observe the response of the application.
  - Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for at least 3 different questions.
expectedResult: The application should process each submission individually, displaying a red pop-up screen for each incorrect answer, without any errors or malfunctions.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Verify rapid consecutive submissions with alternating answer correctness
objective: Test the application's response to rapid consecutive submissions where the correctness of the answers alternates between correct and incorrect.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log into the application as a learner.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the word sorting test.
  - Step 3: For the first question, arrange the letters correctly and rapidly press enter.
  - Step 4: For the second question, deliberately arrange the letters incorrectly and rapidly press enter.
  - Step 5: Alternate between correct and incorrect arrangements for subsequent questions, rapidly pressing enter each time.
  - Step 6: Observe the application's response to each submission.
expectedResult: The application should accurately display a green pop-up screen for each correct answer and a red pop-up screen for each incorrect answer, handling the rapid submissions without error.
