Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify navigation away to Authors page during author creation
objective: Ensure that navigating away to the Authors page during the creation of a new author cancels the operation and does not save the data
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Begin entering data into the form fields for the new author (Name, Bio).
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, select the menu item 'Authors' to navigate away from the creation page.
expectedResult: The data is not saved to the database, and the list of author records is displayed without the new author's data.
explanation: This test case ensures that if a user accidentally or intentionally navigates away to the Authors page during the process of creating a new author, the operation is cancelled, and no incomplete data is saved. It directly matches the scenario of navigating away during author creation to the Authors page.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify cancel operation during author creation navigates to Authors list

  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to initiate the creation of a new author.
  - Step 3: Start entering data into the form fields (Name, Bio) for the new author.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form.
expectedResult: The creation process is cancelled, the data is not saved, and the user is navigated back to the list of authors without the new author's data being added.
