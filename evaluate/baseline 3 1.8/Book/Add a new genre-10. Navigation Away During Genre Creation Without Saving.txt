testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the genre list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start adding a new genre.
  - Step 3: Enter data into the 'Name' and 'Description' fields of the genre.
  - Step 4: Click the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form.

  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to initiate the creation of a new genre.
  - Step 3: Start entering data into the 'Name' and 'Description' fields.
