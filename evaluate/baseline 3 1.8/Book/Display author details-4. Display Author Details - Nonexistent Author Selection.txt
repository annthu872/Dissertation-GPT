Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Display Details of Nonexistent Author
objective: Verify that the application handles the scenario where a user attempts to view details of an author that does not exist in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Attempt to click on the 'Title' of an author that does not exist in the list (simulate this action since the author does not exist).
  - Step 3: Observe the behavior of the application when trying to access details of a nonexistent author.
expectedResult: The application should display an appropriate message indicating that the author details cannot be displayed because the author does not exist.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the application gracefully handles attempts to access details of authors that do not exist in the database, which is a part of the 'Display Author Details - Nonexistent Author Selection' scenario. It tests the application's robustness and user feedback mechanisms in error scenarios.
