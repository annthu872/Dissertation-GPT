Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Update Book and Navigate Away Using Menu Before Submitting
objective: Verify that navigating away using the menu before submitting does not update the book record in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, start entering new data for the book (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, select a menu item (e.g., 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API').
expectedResult: The application navigates to the selected menu item's page without updating the book record in the database. The list of books displayed does not reflect the changes attempted.
explanation: This test case ensures that if a user navigates away from the edit book page using the menu before submitting the changes, the book record remains unchanged. It directly matches the scenario of updating a book and navigating away before submission, ensuring data integrity when the user does not complete the update process.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Update Book and Press Cancel Before Submitting
objective: Verify that pressing the 'Cancel' button before submitting the form does not update the book record in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, start entering new data for the book (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing the 'Submit' button, click the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application does not update the book record in the database and redirects the user to the list of book records, which does not show the attempted changes.
explanation: This test case verifies the functionality of the 'Cancel' button in the edit book form. It ensures that if a user decides not to proceed with updating a book record by pressing 'Cancel', the changes are not saved, maintaining the integrity of the book's original data.
