Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Author Deletion via Cancel Button
objective: Verify that the author deletion process can be canceled successfully using the Cancel button, and ensure the author's data remains unchanged in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Locate the author intended for deletion and click the 'Delete' button next to their name.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application should not delete the author's data from the database and should redirect the user back to the list of author records, showing the author still listed.
explanation: This test case ensures that when a user decides not to proceed with deleting an author by pressing the 'Cancel' button, the deletion process is aborted, and the author's data remains intact in the database.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify Navigation Post-Cancellation of Author Deletion
objective: Ensure that after cancelling the author deletion, navigating to other sections like 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API' displays updated data without deleting the author.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Follow steps 1 to 3 from Test Case 1 to cancel the deletion of an author.
  - Step 2: After cancellation, select the menu item 'Books'.
  - Step 3: Repeat step 2 for 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', and 'API' menu items respectively.
expectedResult: For each navigation action, the application should display the corresponding form with updated data, and the author's data should remain unchanged in the database.
explanation: This test case verifies that after cancelling an author deletion, the user can navigate to other sections of the application without the author's data being affected, ensuring the cancel operation works correctly across the application.
