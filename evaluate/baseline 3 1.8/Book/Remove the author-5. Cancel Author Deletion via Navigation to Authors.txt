Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel Author Deletion via Navigation to 'Authors'
objective: Verify that navigating to 'Authors' after initiating a delete operation cancels the deletion and displays the updated authors list.

  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the author you intend to delete.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
  - Step 4: After cancellation, select the 'Authors' item from the menu.
expectedResult: The author's record should not be deleted from the database, and the authors list should be displayed with the previously selected author still present.

It verifies that the deletion process is aborted and the user is shown the current state of the authors list, confirming the cancel operation's effectiveness.
