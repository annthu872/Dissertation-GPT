testCaseName: Cancel Genre Deletion via Navigation to API

  - Step 1: Navigate to the genre list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Delete' button next to the genre intended for deletion.
  - Step 3: On the confirmation dialog, press the 'Cancel' button.
  - Step 4: From the list of genres page, select the 'API' menu item to navigate to the API page.
expectedResult: The genre should not be deleted from the database, and the API page should display with updated data.
