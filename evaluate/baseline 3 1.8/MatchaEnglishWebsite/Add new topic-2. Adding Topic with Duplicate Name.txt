Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Adding Topic with Duplicate Name
objective: Verify that the system prevents the administrator from adding a new topic with a name that is already used.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Select the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a name that is already used by an existing topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Enter a description for the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Select 'Save' to attempt to create the new topic.
