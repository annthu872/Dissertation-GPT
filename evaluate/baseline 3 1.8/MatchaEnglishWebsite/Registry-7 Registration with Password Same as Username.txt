Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Registration with Password Same as Username
objective: Verify that the system prevents registration when the password is the same as the username.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the registration page.
  - Step 2: Enter a valid username in the username field (ensure the username is over 8 characters and below 30 characters).
  - Step 3: Enter the same value as the username in the password field, ensuring it meets the basic criteria for a valid password (over 8 characters and below 30 characters, contains at least one of each kind: a normal character, a capitalize character, a number, and a special character).
  - Step 4: Press the "Registry" button.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the password cannot be the same as the username and prevent the user from proceeding to the Home page.
explanation: This test case directly addresses the scenario of attempting registration with a password that is identical to the username, which is explicitly prohibited by the use case specification.
