Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Update Room Without Making Any Changes
objective: Verify that the system handles the scenario where an employee attempts to update a room without making any changes to the room's details.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the system as an employee.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the Room panel on the dashboard.
  - Step 3: Search for or select a room to update using its ID.
  - Step 4: Load the room's details but do not make any changes to the fields.
  - Step 5: Press the update button.
expectedResult: The system should validate the fields, update the database (even though no changes were made), and show a success message indicating that the room details have been updated.
explanation: This test case is created to ensure that the system can handle updates to room details even when no actual changes are made by the user. It verifies the system's ability to process and acknowledge an update operation without modifications, which is a realistic scenario that could occur in actual use.

  - Step 2: Navigate to the Room panel on the dashboard.
  - Step 3: Attempt to search for or select a room using an ID that does not exist in the database.
  - Step 4: Try to load the room's details.
expectedResult: The system should display a NOT FOUND message, indicating that the room cannot be updated because it does not exist in the database.
