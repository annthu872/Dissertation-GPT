Given the use case specifications for "adding new topic" by an administrator, the test scenarios provided seem to be unrelated to the use case. Therefore, I will generate relevant test scenarios based on the given use case specifications:

### Test Scenario 1: Successful Topic Addition
**Objective**: Verify that the administrator can successfully add a new topic.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator enters a unique name in the name field.
  3. Administrator enters a description in the description field.
  4. Administrator selects "Save".
- Expected Result: The system adds the new topic and redirects the administrator to the adding vocabulary to the new topic section. The new topic appears in the topic list.

### Test Scenario 2: Adding a Topic with an Already Used Name
**Objective**: Verify that the system prevents adding a new topic with a name that is already used.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in, and there is at least one topic already created.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator enters a name that is already used in the name field.
  3. Administrator enters a description in the description field.
  4. Administrator selects "Save".
- Expected Result: The system shows a notification that the name is already used and prompts the administrator to add another name.

### Test Scenario 3: Cancel Adding a New Topic
**Objective**: Verify that the administrator can cancel the process of adding a new topic.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator enters a name in the name field.
  3. Administrator selects "Cancel".
- Expected Result: The system cancels the adding process and does not create a new topic. The administrator remains on the current page or is redirected to a previous page.

### Test Scenario 4: Adding a Topic without a Name
**Objective**: Verify that the system prevents adding a new topic without a name.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator leaves the name field empty.
  3. Administrator enters a description in the description field.
  4. Administrator selects "Save".
- Expected Result: The system shows an error message indicating that the name field is required.

### Test Scenario 5: Adding a Topic without a Description
**Objective**: Verify that the system allows adding a new topic without a description.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator enters a name in the name field.
  3. Administrator leaves the description field empty.
  4. Administrator selects "Save".
- Expected Result: The system adds the new topic without a description and redirects the administrator to the adding vocabulary to the new topic section. The new topic appears in the topic list.

### Test Scenario 6: Adding a Topic with Special Characters in the Name
**Objective**: Verify how the system handles special characters in the topic name.
- Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
- Steps:
  1. Administrator selects "Add new topic" tab.
  2. Administrator enters a name with special characters in the name field.
  3. Administrator enters a description in the description field.
  4. Administrator selects "Save".
- Expected Result: The system either adds the new topic with the special characters in the name or shows an error message indicating that special characters are not allowed, depending on the system's requirements.

These scenarios cover a range of expected and unexpected user behaviors, ensuring that the functionality for adding a new topic works correctly and handles errors gracefully.
