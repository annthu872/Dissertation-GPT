Given the use case specifications for "adding new topic" by an administrator, the test scenarios provided seem to be unrelated to the use case. Let's create relevant test scenarios that align with the use case of adding a new English learning topic by an administrator.

### Test Scenario 1: Add New Topic - Basic Flow
**Objective**: Verify that the administrator can successfully add a new topic.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the "Add new topic" tab.
  3. Enter a unique name in the name field.
  4. Enter a description in the description field.
  5. Click "Save".
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The system redirects the administrator to the adding vocabulary to the new topic section.
  - The new topic appears in the topic list.

### Test Scenario 2: Add New Topic with Duplicate Name - Alternative Flow
**Objective**: Verify that the system prevents adding a new topic with a name that already exists.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the "Add new topic" tab.
  3. Enter a name that is already used for another topic.
  4. Enter a description.
  5. Click "Save".
  6. Observe the notification and enter a new unique name in the name field.
  7. Click "Save" again.
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The system shows a notification that the name is already used.
  - After entering a new name, the topic is successfully added, and the administrator is redirected to the adding vocabulary section.

### Test Scenario 3: Cancel Adding New Topic - Exception Flow
**Objective**: Verify that the administrator can cancel the process of adding a new topic at any step.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the "Add new topic" tab.
  3. Start adding a new topic but click "Cancel" before saving.
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The adding process is canceled, and the administrator remains or is redirected to the previous page without creating a new topic.

### Test Scenario 4: Add New Topic without Description
**Objective**: Verify the system behavior when adding a new topic without entering a description.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the "Add new topic" tab.
  3. Enter a unique name in the name field.
  4. Leave the description field empty.
  5. Click "Save".
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The system either allows creating a topic without a description or shows a validation message requiring a description.

### Test Scenario 5: Add New Topic with Long Name and Description
**Objective**: Verify the system's ability to handle long names and descriptions for a new topic.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the "Add new topic" tab.
  3. Enter a very long unique name in the name field.
  4. Enter a very long description in the description field.
  5. Click "Save".
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The system either successfully creates a new topic with the long name and description or shows a validation message about maximum length restrictions.

These test scenarios are directly related to the use case and cover the basic, alternative, and exception flows described in the use case specifications.
