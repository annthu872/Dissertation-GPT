Given the use case specifications for "adding new topic" by an administrator, the provided test scenarios seem to be unrelated to the use case. Let's create relevant test scenarios based on the given use case specifications:

### Test Scenarios for "Adding New Topic"

#### Scenario 1: Successful Topic Addition
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in and on the dashboard.
2. Steps: Administrator follows the basic flow from steps 1 to 5.
3. Expected Result: The system successfully adds the new topic, redirects the Administrator to the adding vocabulary section, and the new topic appears in the topic list.

#### Scenario 2: Adding a Topic with an Already Used Name
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in and an existing topic name is known.
2. Steps: Administrator follows the alternative flow from steps 1 to 8.
3. Expected Result: The system prompts the Administrator at step 6 that the name is already used, and after changing the name, the new topic is successfully created.

#### Scenario 3: Cancellation of Topic Addition
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in and on the "Add new topic" page.
2. Steps: Administrator selects "Cancel" at step 3 of the basic flow.
3. Expected Result: The action of adding a new topic is stopped, and the Administrator remains on the "Add new topic" page or is redirected to the previous page.

#### Scenario 4: Adding a Topic Without a Name
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator follows the basic flow but leaves the name field empty and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system prevents the topic from being saved and prompts the Administrator to enter a name.

#### Scenario 5: Adding a Topic Without a Description
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator follows the basic flow but leaves the description field empty and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system allows the topic to be saved without a description, or prompts the Administrator to enter a description, depending on system requirements.

#### Scenario 6: Adding a Topic with Special Characters in the Name
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator enters a name with special characters for the topic and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system either saves the topic with the special characters (if allowed) or prompts the Administrator to use only valid characters.

#### Scenario 7: Adding a Topic with a Very Long Name
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator enters a very long name for the topic and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system either saves the topic with the long name (if allowed) or prompts the Administrator that the name is too long.

#### Scenario 8: Adding a Topic with a Very Long Description
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator enters a very long description for the topic and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system either saves the topic with the long description (if allowed) or prompts the Administrator that the description is too long.

#### Scenario 9: Adding a Topic When Not Logged In
1. Preconditions: Administrator is not logged in.
2. Steps: Attempt to access the "Add new topic" functionality directly via URL or navigation.
3. Expected Result: The system redirects the user to the login page or denies access to the "Add new topic" functionality.

#### Scenario 10: Adding a Topic with HTML Tags in the Description
1. Preconditions: Administrator is logged in.
2. Steps: Administrator enters a description with HTML tags for the topic and attempts to save.
3. Expected Result: The system either saves the topic and sanitizes the HTML tags (preventing XSS attacks) or prompts the Administrator to remove the HTML tags.

These scenarios are directly related to the use case of adding a new topic by an administrator and cover a range of successful, alternative, and exception flows.
