Given the use case specifications for "adding new topic" by an administrator, the test scenarios provided seem to be misaligned with the use case. They appear to be related to a review process rather than the process of adding a new topic. Below are corrected and newly generated test scenarios that are relevant to the specified use case:

1. **TestScenario_AddNewTopic_MainFlow_SuccessfulAddition**
   - Description: Test the successful addition of a new topic by following the basic flow.
