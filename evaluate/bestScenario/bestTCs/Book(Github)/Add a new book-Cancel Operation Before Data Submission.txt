Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation Before Data Submission
objective: Verify that the book creation process can be canceled before data submission and ensure no data is saved to the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start adding a new book.
  - Step 3: Enter book details in the form fields (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing 'Submit', click the 'Cancel' button.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered book data and should redirect the user to the list of book records.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario of canceling an operation before data submission. It clearly outlines steps to initiate a creation process, attempt to input data, and then cancel before final submission, which is the core of the scenario being tested.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation by Navigation Before Data Submission
objective: Verify that navigating away from the book creation page before submitting the form cancels the creation process without saving any data.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start the process of adding a new book.
  - Step 3: Start entering book details in the form (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before pressing 'Submit', select a different menu item (e.g., 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API').
expectedResult: The application should not save the partially entered book data and should display the selected page without adding a new book record.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also reflects the given test scenario accurately. It tests a different method of canceling the operation (navigation away) before data submission, which is a valid path in the scenario of canceling an operation before submission. It ensures that the application behaves as expected when a user changes their mind at any point before the final submission.
