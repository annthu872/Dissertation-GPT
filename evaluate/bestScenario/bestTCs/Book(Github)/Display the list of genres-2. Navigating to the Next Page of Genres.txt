Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Navigate to the Next Page of Genres Using Next Button
objective: Verify that the user can navigate to the next page of genres by clicking the 'Next' button and ensure the next 10 records are displayed correctly.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the application's main page.
  - Step 2: Select the item 'Genres' from the main menu or page content.
  - Step 3: Observe the list of genres displayed on the first page, noting the last genre's id and name.
  - Step 4: Click the 'Next' button located below the list of genres in the pagination block.
  - Step 5: Observe the list of genres on the new page.
expectedResult: After clicking the 'Next' button, the application should display the next page with a new list of 10 genres. The first genre's id on the new page should follow sequentially after the last id observed on the previous page.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario of navigating to the next page of genres. It specifically tests the functionality of the 'Next' button in the pagination block, ensuring that the user can move forward through the list of genres and that the next set of records is displayed correctly, which is the core objective of the given test scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Navigate to the Next Page of Genres Using Page Number
objective: Verify that the user can navigate to the next page of genres by clicking the page number in the pagination block and that the next 10 records are displayed correctly.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the application's main page.
  - Step 2: Select the item 'Genres' from the main menu or page content.
  - Step 3: Observe the list of genres displayed on the first page.
  - Step 4: Identify the page number block below the list of genres and click on the number '2'.
  - Step 5: Observe the list of genres on page 2.
expectedResult: After clicking on the page number '2', the application should display the second page with a new list of 10 genres. The genres displayed should be different from those on the first page, following the correct sequence in the database.
reflect: yes
explanation: Although this test case explores a different method of navigating to the next page of genres (using the page number instead of the 'Next' button), it still directly supports the test scenario's objective of navigating to the next page of genres. It tests the pagination functionality from another valid perspective, ensuring that users can access subsequent pages of genres through the pagination block, which is a critical part of the scenario being tested.
