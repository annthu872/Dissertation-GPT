Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Edit Author with Incorrect Name Data
objective: Verify that the system displays an incorrect data message when attempting to update an author with an invalid name.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: In the form displayed, enter an invalid name (e.g., using numbers or special characters) in the 'Name' field.
  - Step 4: Fill in the 'Bio' field with valid data.
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a message indicating the name data is incorrect.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario 'Author Update with Incorrect Data' by focusing on the validation of the 'Name' field. It specifically tests the system's response to incorrect name data, which is a direct reflection of the scenario's requirement.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Edit Author with Incorrect Bio Data
objective: Verify that the system displays an incorrect data message when attempting to update an author with an invalid biography.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Fill in the 'Name' field with valid data.
  - Step 4: Enter invalid data in the 'Bio' field (e.g., inserting a script tag).
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The system should display a message indicating the biography data is incorrect.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case is relevant to the test scenario as it tests the system's ability to validate the 'Bio' field for incorrect data. It complements the scenario by ensuring that not only the 'Name' field but also the 'Bio' field is checked for data integrity, thus reflecting the scenario's broader requirement of handling incorrect data updates.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Edit Author with All Incorrect Data
objective: Verify that the system displays incorrect data messages for all fields when attempting to update an author with entirely invalid data.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the author you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Enter invalid data in the 'Name' field (e.g., using numbers or special characters).
  - Step 4: Enter invalid data in the 'Bio' field (e.g., inserting a script tag).
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The system should display messages indicating that both the name and biography data are incorrect.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case perfectly encapsulates the test scenario by verifying the system's response to updates with entirely incorrect data across multiple fields. It tests the comprehensive validation mechanism of the system, ensuring that all aspects of the scenario are covered by checking for incorrect data in both the 'Name' and 'Bio' fields simultaneously.
