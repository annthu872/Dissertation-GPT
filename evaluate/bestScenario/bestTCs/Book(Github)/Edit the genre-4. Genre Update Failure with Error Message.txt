Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Genre Update Failure Due to Incorrect Data
objective: Verify that the application displays incorrect data messages when user enters invalid genre data during an update operation
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the genre list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the genre you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, enter invalid data into the 'Name' and/or 'Description' fields.
  - Step 4: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The application displays messages indicating the data entered is incorrect.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by verifying that an error message is displayed when incorrect data is entered during a genre update operation. It tests the application's ability to validate input and provide feedback, which is the core of the test scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Genre Update Failure with System Error Message
objective: Verify that the application displays an error message when a system error occurs during the genre update process
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the genre list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the genre you wish to update.
  - Step 3: On the displayed form, enter valid data into the 'Name' and 'Description' fields.
  - Step 4: Simulate a system error (this step may involve actions like disconnecting the database connection temporarily or using a mock to simulate the error condition).
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
expectedResult: The application displays an error message indicating that the update operation could not be completed due to a system error.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also reflects the given test scenario by focusing on a different aspect of failure - system errors. It verifies that the application communicates effectively with the user when an update operation fails not due to user input but due to internal system issues. It complements the first test case by covering another failure mode within the same scenario.
