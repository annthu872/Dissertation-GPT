objective: Verify that navigating away from the author creation form without submitting it cancels the operation and no data is saved
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the author list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the form for adding a new author.
  - Step 3: Start entering author's details into the form fields.
  - Step 4: Without submitting the form, select the menu item 'Books', 'Genres', 'Authors', 'Home', or 'API'.
expectedResult: The application should not save the entered data and should display the corresponding form or page selected from the menu.
explanation: This test case verifies that if a user navigates away from the author creation form by selecting another menu item, the operation is cancelled and no data is saved. It addresses the scenario where the user decides to cancel by navigating away instead of explicitly pressing a cancel button.
