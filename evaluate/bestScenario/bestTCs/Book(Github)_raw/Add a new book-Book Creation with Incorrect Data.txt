Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Book Creation with Missing Mandatory Fields
objective: Verify that the system displays correct error messages for missing mandatory fields during book creation
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the book creation form.
  - Step 3: Leave the 'Title', 'Author', and 'Genre' fields empty.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Book Creation with Incorrect Data Format
objective: Verify that the system displays an error message for incorrect data format in the 'Publication date' field
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to open the book creation form.
  - Step 3: Fill in the 'Title', 'Author', and 'Genre' fields with valid data.
  - Step 4: Enter an incorrect format data into the 'Publication date' field (e.g., 'abcd').
  - Step 5: Press the 'Submit' button.
