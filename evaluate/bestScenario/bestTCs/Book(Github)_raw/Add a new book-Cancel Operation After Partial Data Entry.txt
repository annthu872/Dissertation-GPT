Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Cancel New Book Creation After Partial Data Entry by Cancel Button
objective: Verify that the book creation process can be canceled after partial data entry by using the 'Cancel' button and ensure that no data is saved in the database.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start adding a new book.
  - Step 3: On the book creation form, enter partial data for the new book (e.g., Title and Author).
  - Step 4: Press the 'Cancel' button before completing all fields and submitting.
  - Step 5: Confirm any prompt (if any) to ensure cancellation of the book creation process.
expectedResult: The application should navigate back to the list of books without adding the partially entered book data to the database.
