Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Navigate Away Using API Selection During Genre Creation
objective: Verify that selecting 'API' from the menu while adding a new genre cancels the operation and navigates away without saving data
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the genre list page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Create new' button to start adding a new genre.
  - Step 3: Begin entering data into the 'Name' and 'Description' fields of the genre creation form.
  - Step 4: Without pressing the 'Submit' button, select 'API' from the menu.
expectedResult: The application does not save the entered genre data and navigates to the API page, displaying the corresponding form with updated data.
