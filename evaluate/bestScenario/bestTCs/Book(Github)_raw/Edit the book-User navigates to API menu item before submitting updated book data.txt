testSteps:
  - Step 1: Navigate to the book list/details page.
  - Step 2: Click the 'Update' button next to the book you wish to update.
  - Step 3: Begin entering new data for the book in the provided form fields (Title, Author, Genre, Description, Publication Date).
  - Step 4: Before clicking the 'Submit' button, navigate to the API menu item.
expectedResult: The book data is not updated in the database, and the API page is displayed.
