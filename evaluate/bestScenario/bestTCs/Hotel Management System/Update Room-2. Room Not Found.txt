explanation: This test case directly addresses the 'Room Not Found' scenario by simulating an attempt to interact with a room that does not exist in the system. It is designed to verify the system's behavior in such a situation, ensuring that it appropriately notifies the user that the room could not be found, which is the exact purpose of the test scenario.
