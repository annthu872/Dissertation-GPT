reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the 'EmailInexistent' scenario by attempting to register with an email that is either non-existent or incorrectly formatted. The steps are designed to trigger the system's validation process for email addresses during registration, and the expected result is a notification of invalid email, which is the exact outcome the test scenario aims to verify.
