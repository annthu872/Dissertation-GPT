Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify Topic Creation with Unique Name
objective: Ensure that the system allows the creation of a new topic with a unique name and redirects to the adding vocabulary section.

  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Select the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a unique name in the name field.
  - Step 4: Enter a description for the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Select 'Save' to create the new topic.
expectedResult: The system should successfully create the new topic and redirect the administrator to the adding vocabulary to new topic section. The new topic should appear in the topic list.
explanation: This test case verifies that the system functions correctly when an administrator adds a new topic with a unique name, following the basic flow of the use case.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify Topic Creation with Duplicate Name
objective: Ensure that the system prevents the creation of a new topic with a name that is already used and prompts for a new name.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in as an administrator.
  - Step 2: Select the 'Add new topic' tab on the navigation bar.
  - Step 3: Enter a name that is already used for an existing topic in the name field.
  - Step 4: Enter a description for the topic in the description field.
  - Step 5: Select 'Save' to attempt to create the new topic.
  - Step 6: Observe the notification that the name is already used.
  - Step 7: Enter a new, unique name in the name field.
  - Step 8: Select 'Save' again to create the topic.
expectedResult: The system should display a notification that the name is already used after step 5 and allow the administrator to enter a new name, successfully creating the topic upon the second save attempt.
explanation: This test case ensures that the system correctly implements the alternative flow for handling duplicate topic names, preventing the creation of topics with duplicate names and prompting for a new name.
