Test Case: Test Case 1
testCaseName: Verify product erased by seller is unselectable in shopping cart
objective: Ensure that products erased by the seller cannot be selected for checkout in the shopping cart.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the user account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the shopping cart page where previously added items are present.
  - Step 3: Attempt to select a product that has been erased by the seller by clicking on the checkbox before the item.
expectedResult: The checkbox for the erased product should not be clickable, and the product cannot be selected for checkout.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case directly addresses the test scenario by verifying that products erased by the seller are indeed unselectable in the shopping cart, which is the core requirement of the scenario.

Test Case: Test Case 2
testCaseName: Verify checkout button is disabled with only erased products selected
objective: To confirm that the checkout process is halted if all selected products in the cart have been erased by the seller.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the user account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the shopping cart page with items added previously.
  - Step 3: Ensure all available products in the cart have been erased by the seller but are still displayed.
  - Step 4: Attempt to select all erased products by clicking on their respective checkboxes.
  - Step 5: Observe the state of the 'Checkout' button.
expectedResult: The 'Checkout' button remains disabled since all selected items are invalid for purchase.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case is relevant to the scenario as it tests the system's response to a cart containing only erased products, ensuring that the checkout process cannot proceed, which aligns with the scenario's focus on handling erased products.

Test Case: Test Case 3
testCaseName: Verify mixed selection of valid and erased products in shopping cart
objective: Ensure that the checkout process can proceed with valid products even if erased products are present in the cart.
testSteps:
  - Step 1: Log in to the user account.
  - Step 2: Navigate to the shopping cart page where both valid and erased items are present.
  - Step 3: Select all valid products by clicking on the checkboxes before each.
  - Step 4: Attempt to select erased products.
  - Step 5: Click on the 'Checkout' button.
expectedResult: The system allows the checkout process to proceed with only the valid selected products, ignoring the erased items.
reflect: yes
explanation: This test case also reflects the given test scenario by demonstrating how the system differentiates between valid and erased products during the checkout process, ensuring that only valid items can be purchased. It tests the scenario's requirement from another angle, focusing on the coexistence of valid and erased products in the cart.
