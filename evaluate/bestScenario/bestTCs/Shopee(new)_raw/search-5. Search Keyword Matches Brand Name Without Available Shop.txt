  - Step 1: Navigate to the search bar on the platform.
  - Step 2: Type a keyword that matches a brand name without an available shop in the search bar.
  - Step 3: Press enter or click the search icon to initiate the search.
expectedResult: The system displays the most related/best sold shops that sell the brand at the top of the search result, including shop name, number of items, ratings, and response rate, average response time, followed by related product cards (products that have names matching the search keyword).
