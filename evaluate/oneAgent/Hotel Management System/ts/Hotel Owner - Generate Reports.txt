2. **Generate Report with Invalid Parameters**: This scenario tests the system's response when the hotel owner tries to generate a report with invalid parameters, triggering the validation error.

3. **Generate Report with Boundary Date Parameters**: This scenario checks the system's ability to handle reports generated with date parameters at the boundary of valid input (e.g., the earliest or latest possible dates).

4. **Generate Report with Maximum Data Range**: This scenario tests the system's performance and capability to generate a report with the maximum allowable date range or data volume.

5. **Generate Report with Minimum Data Range**: This scenario assesses the system's handling of reports generated with the minimum data range, such as a single day.

6. **Access Report with No Data Available**: This scenario evaluates how the system handles attempts to generate a report for a period where no data is available.

7. **Generate Multiple Reports Consecutively**: This scenario tests the system's ability to handle consecutive report generation requests without errors or performance degradation.

8. **Generate Report and Navigate Away Before Completion**: This scenario checks how the system handles situations where the user navigates away from the report generation page before the report is fully generated.

9. **Generate Report with Special Characters in Parameters**: This scenario tests the system's handling of special characters in the report parameters, such as using symbols in date fields.

10. **Generate Report with Simultaneous Users**: This scenario assesses the system's performance and accuracy when multiple hotel owners generate reports at the same time.

11. **Access Previously Generated Report**: This scenario tests the ability of the hotel owner to access and view details of reports that were generated in the past.

12. **Generate Report with Future Date Parameters**: This scenario checks the system's response to attempts to generate a report for a future date range, which should not have any data.

13. **Generate Report Without Selecting Parameters**: This scenario evaluates the system's behavior when the user attempts to generate a report without specifying any parameters.

14. **Refresh Report Details Page**: This scenario tests the system's ability to refresh the report details page without errors or loss of data.
