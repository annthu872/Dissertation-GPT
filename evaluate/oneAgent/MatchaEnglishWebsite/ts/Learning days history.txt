6. **Check Learning Days with Intermittent Use Scenario** - This scenario tests how the system calculates and displays learning days for a learner who uses the application intermittently, with gaps in their learning history.

7. **Learning Days Display Error Handling Scenario** - This scenario checks how the system handles and displays errors if there's an issue fetching the learning days history.

8. **Check Learning Days Without Internet Connection Scenario** - This scenario tests the application's behavior when a learner tries to check their learning days without an internet connection.

9. **Check Learning Days After Re-login Scenario** - This scenario ensures that the learning days history is accurately maintained and displayed even after the learner logs out and then logs back into the application.
